# CoPA Cabana - The Exascale Co-Design Center for Particle Applications Toolkit

Cabana is a performance portable library for particle-based
simulations. Applications include but are not limited to Molecular Dynamics
(MD) with either short- and/or long-range interactions and various flavors of
Particle-in-Cell (PIC) methods, including applications to fluid and solid
mechanics and plasma physics. Cabana provides particle data structures,
algorithms, and utilities to enable simulations on a variety of platforms
including many-core architectures and GPUs.

Cabana is developed as part of the Co-Design Center for Particle Applications
(CoPA) within the Exascale Computing Project (ECP) under the U.S. Department
of Energy. CoPA is a multi-institutional project with developers from ORNL,
LANL, SNL, LLNL, PPNL, and ANL.

## Documentation

Instructions for building Cabana on various platforms, an API reference with
tutorial links, and links to the Doxygen can be found in our
[wiki](https://github.com/ECP-copa/Cabana/wiki).

For Cabana-related questions you can open a GitHub issue to interact with the
developers.
